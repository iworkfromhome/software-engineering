# Job Aggregation Algorithm

We currently feed this job board from remoteok.io and weworkremotely.com

A nightly job synchronizes job listings from these sites:

- new jobs will appear first in the issues list
- removed jobs will have the correspoding issue closed

We map relevant tags/keywords to labels to make filtering easier.
